 essay:
  [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mThank you for giving my application a thorough review and the opportunity to further demonstrate my interest in Boston College. While I respect the committeeâ€™s decision to place me on the waitlist, I hope to show you another side of me that may not have been fully captured in my first submission.[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mSince applying, I have maintained an IB score of 38/42, and have continued to challenge myself to grow my intellectual curiosity and character beyond school. I remain committed to my extracurricular activities, now serving as Chair of our MUN club, acting coach to the cast of our school production, and intern at Amoz HZ Taka & Associates. As Chair of MUN, I facilitated various conferences, ensuring that discussions encouraged participation from all delegates and that conference logistics flowed smoothly. As acting coach of the production, I worked closely with each cast member to pull them out of their shells - to understand and embrace their characters fully. As an intern at one of Surabayaâ€™s well-known law firms, I continued to learn about Indonesiaâ€™s justice system, gaining direct exposure to some of Surabayaâ€™s key cases battling corruption as well as domestic disputes. These experiences refined my skills in leadership, communication, and collaboration. Ultimately, I believe these qualities will equip me to better contribute to the BC community.[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mFurthermore, using my IB tutor role as a platform, I began a project close to my heart: mentoring a group of younger students to help through their academic and personal struggles. These sessions taught me to empathize with and understand just how harmful seemingly small events can be to your mental wellbeing and, consequently, your ability to focus and engage with others. My objective was to show students that although we all have burdens, those burdens can either teach us to handle pressure with poise or weigh us down.[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mAs the semester progressed, what was meant to be one big push to review two yearsâ€™ worth of IB material came to a halt due to the pandemic. When school and exams were canceled, many of the initiatives I had planned for had to be shelved. I pivoted to a new way of learning.[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mI grew up a voracious reader with an insatiable desire to learn beyond the classroom. An ever-growing list of books became my way of exploring my interests in an enjoyable, independent, and academic manner. My more memorable readings included The Tattooist of Auschwitz, a biographical fiction novel set during the Holocaust. As I read, I saw several parallels to the worldâ€™s current challenges, especially the social and racial issues that are becoming increasingly evident due to the pandemic. Naturally, my mind began to ponder on why they existed and how they might be combated in this day and age. Reading of my own volition while having the time to properly observe the state of the world around me, I was reminded of educationâ€™s true value: to connect what we learn with what we observe in order to impact our communities in meaningful and positive ways. [1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mAs I await your response, I recognize my aspirations and learning journey do not end with this letter. BC continues to be my dream school, and there is no doubt that given the opportunity, I want to be an Eagle. At BC, I hope to immerse myself in a multitude of research centers which gives students the chance to work on real-world issues alongside scholars, practitioners, and other students who are constantly challenging themselves. These include the Center for Human Rights and International Justice (CHRIJ) and the Global Leadership Institute, which I hope will expose me to thought leaders and a way of thinking that will allow me to listen, understand, and hopefully, become an agent of change within the BC community and beyond.[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31mThank you for your time and consideration. I hope you stay healthy and safe, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. If there is anything further youâ€™d like to understand about me or my application, please feel free to reach out - I would appreciate any opportunity to express my full interest.[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m[32m>[0m
